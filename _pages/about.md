Hello! I am a Bioinformatics Postdoctoral Fellow in [Barbara Engelhardt's lab](https://www.stanfordgladstonebeehive.com/) at UCSF-Gladstone and Stanford University. My current research involves developing deep learning models to jointly analyze live-cell imaging and genomic data, with the end-goal of developing safer and more effective immunotherapies. Previously, I completed my Computational Biology PhD in [Sohrab Shah's lab](https://componcmsk.org/shah-lab/) at MSKCC where I developed Bayesian models to study cancer evolution, DNA copy number, and replication timing. I received my BS in Bioengineering at UCLA while using binding kinetic models and tensor factorization to engineer mutant IL-2 cytokines in [Aaron Meyer's lab](https://asmlab.org/). My interests are broad but can be best described as wishing use machine learning to better understand, and therefore thereapeutically combat, complex diseases such as cancer and immune disorders.
