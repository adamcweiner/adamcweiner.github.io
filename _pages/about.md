Hello! I am a [Tri-Institutional PhD Student in Computational Biology & Medicine](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) living in NYC. I currently work in [Dr. Sohrab Shah's lab](https://componcmsk.org/shah-lab/) at MSKCC where I study cancer evolution at the single-cell level. As an undergraduate at UCLA, I worked in [Dr. Aaron Meyer's lab](https://asmlab.org/) where we developed machine learning frameworks for engineering mutant cytokines into immunotherapeutics and monitoring tumor heterogeneity of drug responses. My interests are broad but can be best described as wishing to develop methods that help researchers understand (and thus therapeutically leverage) cancer evolution.
