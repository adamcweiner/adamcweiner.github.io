Hello! I am a [Tri-Institutional PhD Student in Computational Biology & Medicine](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) living in NYC. I currently work in [Dr. Sohrab Shah's lab](https://componcmsk.org/shah-lab/) at MSKCC where I study cancer evolution at the single-cell level. My current research focuses on the interplay between DNA replication dynamics and genomic instability. As an undergraduate at UCLA, I worked in [Dr. Aaron Meyer's lab](https://asmlab.org/) where we used data-driven modeling to engineer mutant cytokines and monitor tumor drug response heterogeneity. My interests are broadly focused on using machine learning to understand and therapeutically leverage cancer evolution.
